##Ferrari Wins the 2024 24 Hours of Le Mans##
Ferrari has triumphed in the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans, marking their 11th overall victory and their second consecutive win with the 499P following last year's centenary success. The winning team comprised Antonio Fuoco, Miguel Molina, and Nicklas Nielsen in the #50 499P, who now join the ranks of last year's champions Alessandro Pier Guidi, James Calado, and Antonio Giovinazzi.
Despite a race marred by persistent rain that complicated strategies and disrupted plans, Ferrari managed to emerge victorious once again. This year's competition was fierce, with 23 hypercars vying for supremacy on the track. Let's delve into the details of this exceptional race and examine the performance of the winning Ferrari and its competitors.
The 499P: A Legend in the Making
#A Surprising Yellow Ferrari#
After last year’s centenary victory, Ferrari was a strong contender for this year's 92nd 24 Hours of Le Mans. The 499P, known for its prowess, consistently performed well, but what caught many by surprise was the strong performance of the yellow private entry driven by Robert Kubica, Robert Shwartzman, and Yifei Ye, which often overshadowed the red factory cars.
From the race's outset, the factory entries #50 and #51 set the pace. Nicklas Nielsen in the #50 took the lead from Porsche Penske Motorsport's Laurens Vanthoor in the pole-sitting #6 Porsche 963. Shortly thereafter, Antonio Giovinazzi in the #51 Ferrari also overtook Vanthoor. Within just 13 minutes, the two factory Ferraris were leading the pack. Meanwhile, Robert Kubica in the #83 Ferrari started from 12th and quickly climbed to fifth place, demonstrating the team's strong performance early on.
However, the tifosi's hopes for Ferrari's total domination were dampened when the weather turned. Around 17:40, the first raindrops fell, forcing teams to make swift strategic decisions. Some hypercars, including the #51 Ferrari, the #4 Porsche, and the #7 Toyota, switched to wet-weather tires early. This decision proved to be a misstep for many. André Lotterer, who had taken over from Laurens Vanthoor in the #6 Porsche, also opted for wet tires, which turned out to be a poor choice.
Kubica's #83 499P, equipped with soft slicks, handled the changing conditions better. As the track dried, Robert Shwartzman took over from Kubica and increased their lead lap by lap. This tire strategy was crucial in maintaining their advantage as the weather improved.
##LMP2 and GT3 Categories##
#LMP2#
In the LMP2 category, the competition was intense. The #22 United Autosport, driven by Bijoy Garg, Oliver Jarvis, and Nolan Seigel, emerged victorious. They were followed by the #34 Enter Europol Competition team of Vladislav Lomko, Clement Novalak, and Jakub Smiechowski. The third place was claimed by the #28 IDEC Sport team comprising Reshad de Gerus, Paul Lafargue, and Job van Uitert.
#LMGT3#
In the LMGT3 category, the #91 Manthey EMA team, with Richard Lietz, Morris Schuring, and Yasser Shahin, secured the top spot. They were followed by the #31 Team WRT team of Augusto Farfus, Sean Gelael, and Darren Leung. The #88 Proton Competition team, driven by Dennis Olsen, Mikkel O. Pedersen, and Giorgio Roda, rounded out the podium.
#The Hypercar Battle#
As the race progressed, 11 cars remained on the lead lap with potential for victory. However, not all manufacturers could sustain the pace. Cadillac lost two cars, one to an oil leak (#3 Cadillac V-Series.R) and another to a spectacular accident (#311 Cadillac V-Series.R). Porsche also faced difficulties, with Felipe Nasr crashing the #4 963 into the tire wall at Indianapolis, and the #5 and #6 963s struggling to keep up.
By midday, the race's intensity increased. Antonio Fuoco's fastest lap time of 3:29.208 was surpassed by Alex Palou in the #2 Cadillac V-Series.R with a time of 3:28.938, followed by Kamui Kobayashi in the #7 Toyota GR010 Hybrid with a time of 3:28.756.
The final rain shower before 14:00 added another layer of complexity. The drizzle turned into a heavier downpour, particularly affecting the first sector of the track. Brendon Hartley drove off at Mulsanne Corner after being nudged by Alessandro Pier Guidi in the #51 Ferrari. This incident disrupted what could have been a Ferrari one-two finish. Ultimately, the #7 Toyota GR010-Hybrid, driven by José María López, Kamui Kobayashi, and Nyck de Vries, managed to split the Ferraris, finishing second just 14.221 seconds behind the winning Ferrari.
The race saw numerous safety car periods due to rain and fog, making the track unsafe for racing. This led to frequent changes in the race leader, with Toyota, Porsche, and Ferrari all taking turns at the front. It wasn't until dawn that the race returned to green conditions, with the battle for the lead intensifying.
In the 18th hour, the #50 Ferrari made significant progress, overtaking the #83 Ferrari and the #5 Porsche to take second place. This position became first when the #2 Cadillac, out of sync on pit stops, stopped to switch to wet tires. Despite receiving a five-second time penalty for colliding with the #8 Toyota, Pier Guidi managed to secure the final podium spot in the #51 Ferrari, finishing just ahead of the #6 Porsche driven by Laurens Vanthoor.
Pre-race favorite Porsche had to settle for fourth position, with Vanthoor finishing just 1.1 seconds behind Pier Guidi. The #6 Porsche had led the race in the 18th hour but had to pit under a safety car, which dropped them down the order.
Cadillac emerged as a surprise contender in the final hours, with the #2 V-Series.R driven by Alex Lynn, Earl Bamber, and Alex Palou leading before the last safety car period. However, any advantage was negated by the final rain shower, which put the entire Hypercar field on wet tires simultaneously. In the end, Palou brought the #2 Cadillac home in seventh place, ahead of the two customer Jota Porsches.
Peugeot had another challenging outing with their new 9X8 2024. Despite showing promise, the car struggled for pace in all conditions. The best-placed Peugeot, driven by Stoffel Vandoorne, Paul di Resta, and Loic Duval, finished 11th, three laps down on the winning Toyota, after receiving a drive-through penalty for overtaking under a slow zone.
The Lamborghini team, making their debut in the Hypercar class, had a solid performance without any major issues. The #63 Lamborghini, driven by Mirko Bortolotti, Daniil Kvyat, and Edoardo Mortara, finished 10th, while the sister #19 car, driven by Romain Grosjean, Andrea Caldarelli, and Matteo Cairoli, finished 13th.
Isotta Fraschini was the only other new manufacturer classified, with the #11 Tipo6-C driven by Jean-Karl Vernay, Carl Wattana Bennett, and Antonio Serravalle finishing 14th. BMW and Alpine, despite showing promise before the race, faced engine failures that led to their double retirements. The #15 BMW M Hybrid V8, driven by Marco Wittmann, Dries Vanthoor, and Sheldon van der Linde, was particularly affected, with early setbacks and crashes hampering their progress.
The #83 customer Ferrari, which led a significant portion of the race, retired with technical issues in the 20th hour. The #3 Cadillac and the #4 Porsche were among the six Hypercar entries not classified due to various issues.
#Porsche Triumphs in LMGT3 Class#
Porsche secured another win in the new-for-2024 LMGT3 class. The #91 Manthey EMA 911 GT3 R, driven by Richard Lietz, Yasser Shahin, and Morris Schuring, took top honors. The victory boiled down to a battle between the Manthey Porsche and the #31 WRT team of Augusto Farfus, Sean Gelael, and Darren Leung. Despite the rain returning with just over two hours to go, factory Porsche driver Lietz managed to overtake Gelael and lead the #91 crew to the first-ever LMGT3 victory at Le Mans.
The #92 Manthey PureRxcing entry was also in contention for much of the race but was forced to retire due to electrical problems. Proton Competition took third and fourth places with their pair of Ford Mustang GT3s. The #88 car of Dennis Olsen, Giorgio Roda, and Mikkel Pedersen finished ahead of the #89 entry driven by Christopher Mies, Ben Tuck, and John Hartshorne.
All three McLaren 720S GT3 entries faced issues on Sunday, leaving them out of contention despite showing promise earlier in the race.
