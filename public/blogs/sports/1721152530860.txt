##Canadian Grand Prix Review##
#Overview#
At first glance, the Canadian Grand Prix seemed like another straightforward victory for Red Bull as Max Verstappen secured his 41st career win. However, the race was far more complex than the headline suggests.
Verstappen’s race wasn’t without its challenges; he hit a bird, which got stuck in his brake duct. This incident raised questions about what might have happened if Fernando Alonso had been able to pressure the championship leader. Additionally, some speculated that Lewis Hamilton's apparent speed was due to Alonso conserving fuel, which Aston Martin boss Mike Krack later confirmed was a precaution to ensure Alonso could finish the race.
Alonso overtook Hamilton on Lap 22 after a slow start, the cause of which remains unclear. Despite Mercedes’ struggles with tire warm-up, Hamilton’s ability to maintain his position early on indicated his car wasn’t at a significant disadvantage compared to the Aston Martin. Track position proved crucial, especially after the Safety Car restart when Alonso couldn't immediately pass Hamilton and only succeeded after ten laps, by which time tire temperatures and pressures had stabilized.
Hamilton's consistent performance kept Alonso honest, showcasing the potential of the Mercedes despite its limitations. Meanwhile, Ferrari made strategic moves, with both cars climbing the order, and Alex Albon scored significant points for Williams. Valtteri Bottas also finished in the top 10, all benefiting from strategic gambles.
When George Russell hit the wall on Lap 12, the race strategy split. Pirelli had suggested a two-stop strategy, but Russell's crash prompted different approaches. Those who pitted early gained an advantage, while others, like Ferrari, chose to stay out, banking on track position and tire management.
Ferrari's decision to stay out required Leclerc and Sainz to either hold their positions or build a gap to offset potential time loss. This gamble showed confidence in their car’s performance, a positive shift from Ferrari's usual conservative strategies. Kevin Magnussen, however, didn't fare as well, struggling with tire degradation.
Williams' Albon pitted early, allowing him to benefit later as others made their stops. His car’s straight-line speed helped him maintain his position despite pressure from behind. Bottas, employing a similar strategy, managed to secure a point despite tire issues.
McLaren’s performance was expected; cooler conditions helped Piastri and Norris, but as the race warmed up, their competitiveness waned. McLaren anticipates significant upgrades in Austria, marking the beginning of a transformation for their car.
Overall, the Canadian Grand Prix highlighted the thin line between success and failure in Formula 1, with strategic decisions playing a crucial role in determining the race outcome.
#Another win for Max Verstappen#
Max Verstappen and Red Bull rebounded from their difficulties in Monaco by securing a victory at the thrilling Canadian Grand Prix. The race was marked by rain showers, several Safety Car periods, restarts, and a tough competition from behind, but Verstappen managed to finish ahead of Lando Norris.
In the early wet stages of the race, Verstappen trailed behind pole-sitter George Russell of Mercedes. As the conditions improved, Norris overtook both drivers. However, a poorly-timed Safety Car, triggered by Logan Sargeant’s crash, caused Norris to fall to third place.
Verstappen, having overtaken Russell, expertly handled the restart and subsequent rain showers to maintain his lead. He successfully defended his position as the track dried and the field switched from intermediate tyres to slicks, and again after a second Safety Car incident involving Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon.
While the reigning world champion charged towards the finish line, Norris secured second place after a tough mid-race duel with Russell. Russell eventually finished third following some late-race battles with his teammate Lewis Hamilton and Oscar Piastri of McLaren.
#Ferrari’s Disaster weekend#
Ferrari has vowed to undertake a "deep analysis" following a dismal Canadian Grand Prix weekend, where neither car made it to Q3, and the team left with no points after an exceptionally poor performance.
The qualifying disaster in Montreal, where Leclerc experienced a puzzling lack of grip at the start of his flying laps, was traced back to starting with tire pressures that were set too low. The newly resurfaced track was smoother than in previous years, and the mixed weather and relatively cold temperatures exacerbated tire warm-up issues for a car designed to be gentler on its tires compared to 2023.
Despite starting just outside the top 10, Ferrari's strong race performance this season had led the team to expect a competitive fight at the front with McLaren and Red Bull. However, Leclerc revealed he was losing 1.2 seconds per lap on the straights in Montreal due to an engine issue in the early part of the race. Ferrari has not yet clarified the exact nature of the engine problem, but team boss Fred Vasseur mentioned it was related to the "control" of the engine, suggesting a software-related issue.
Leclerc had to make ten engine switch changes per lap while the problem persisted, and a prolonged pit stop to switch to slick tires revealed that the issue was only resolved by turning the engine off and restarting the car. Ferrari had hoped to perform this reset under a red flag after Logan Sargeant's crash, but the red flag never materialized.
The lengthy process to fix the engine problem, taking 30-40 seconds according to Vasseur, quickly turned Leclerc’s race into a lost cause. Although the car handled well in corners on intermediate tires and Ferrari had been confident about its race pace, everything went wrong from the start.
Identifying the tire pressure issue in qualifying may mean this was a one-off anomaly, and Ferrari can expect to bounce back at other tracks. However, the weekend served as a stark reminder of how a strong team can falter in the closely contested front of the grid in F1.
The fine line between success and failure in Formula 1 is evident, and it will be interesting to see how Fred Vasseur manages the aftermath of what was undeniably a disastrous race weekend. His positive and effective management style offers hope that this poor performance was just an isolated incident. It’s a relief it didn’t happen in Italy!
#A resurgent Mercedes#
Mercedes surprised everyone by achieving a dramatic tie for pole position in Montreal. Although their chances for a win diminished on Sunday, they demonstrated that they are back in contention for podium finishes.
This team hasn't secured a victory in 18 months and has faced a frustrating start to 2024, struggling to understand the issues with their latest car concept. They are cautiously optimistic about this being a breakthrough that will sustain their performance throughout the season. In Montreal, the car finally provided the drivers with a front end they could trust, enabling them to attack the circuit's slow, wall-lined corners confidently.
Mercedes’ best performance and result of 2024 was followed by both Formula 1 drivers admitting they did not perform as well as they could have. George Russell and Lewis Hamilton finished third and fourth in the Canadian Grand Prix. Russell, who started from pole, led early and remained in the lead group throughout the race. Hamilton, starting from seventh due to a late qualifying slump, showed patience and strong pace, nearly securing a podium ahead of Russell despite a challenging race.
On paper, their performance was commendable, especially given the mixed conditions of the race. However, both drivers felt it was a missed opportunity considering the significant improvement in performance compared to the rest of the 2024 season. Russell, starting from pole, overused his intermediates early on, losing crucial track positions to Max Verstappen and Lando Norris. Although a safety car later helped him regain position, a mistake caused him to fall behind Norris again. After colliding with Oscar Piastri, Russell dropped to fifth, acknowledging that too many mistakes at critical moments cost them a shot at victory.
Mercedes has made significant progress recently, and despite specific conditions this weekend, there is increasing confidence that the team is mastering the current regulations. However, this will require their drivers to sharpen their skills. Russell, currently more comfortable than Hamilton in qualifying, received a rare mid-race radio message from Toto Wolff to “focus” after an error dropped him behind Norris. While Russell's speed is undeniable, his tire management and judgment need refinement, as evidenced by his unforced errors.
Hamilton, on the other hand, finds a silver lining, noting that the Mercedes is becoming “a car we can fight with.” His pace is competitive enough to challenge Russell on Saturdays, and his performance on Sundays remains strong.
