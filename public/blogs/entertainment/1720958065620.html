        <p><h2>The Girl On The Train - Paula Hawkins</h2><br><br>            Life, men and women are probably those three things that fuss a lot. Never satisfied, never convinced and never really truthful. Some of that very fuss, that completely unnecessary, untimely and unwanted fuss is the central item around which this nail biting thriller wheels around. <br><br>            In this Paula’s first book, set around the London suburbs which couldn't have been more beautifully described than through the eyes of Rachel, a daily train commuter to London. A woman tired with her work, with life and with herself. Her tiredness due to her inability to bear a child. Tom, her husband supported her in all the ways he could but she couldn't come to terms with herself. She was upset, turned to drinking and became its frequent indulger. Each time with a more fierce hangover and a blanker hour of action, where she would do things that she couldn't believe she could do. Tom got tired of this and found another woman, more stable, more loving and younger to be showered with and shower love. Her name was Anna. Rachel's case worsened as she was bought off her own house and shooed away like she was nothing.<br><br>            With all this pent up frustration and anger, she put up a staright face and commuted for work by train, which by cruel play of life had to pass behind the backs of a row of houses, one of them being hers  - Anna’s now and her baby. But she was intersted about another house. A house whose occupants were  a beautiful couple so in love that reminded Rachel her old days with Tom. She didn't know them, but her daily travel to and fro just across their house made her feel she was connected to them, she felt obligated to protect that intimacy they shared. She gave them names that she seemed suited for them. Jason and Jess, she decided. But ofcourse in this fussy world, without a little fuss nothing runs, through the same window which showed Jess in her peaceful lovey dovey life, showed her kissing a complete stranger !! She felt sad but anger overtook soon. Why would Jess want to cheat when everything could'nt be more perfect in her life? She wanted to confront her that day. She thought drinking would give her more edge while confronting, but the next day she got up bruises on her arms and legs and with no memory as to what happened that night. Shockingly she realised that the same night was the night that Megan (Jess) went missing !!<br><br>         What happened that night? What did her memory betray her off? Was she involved or someone else? Her memory a complete haze unwilling to uncloud. She wanted to help, there was this involuntary need to do so. Guilt maybe? But of what?. She went to Scott (Jason) to tell him about what she knows and each visit clearing a part of the haze but causing problems with Anna and Tom. Anna being overly possessive over her new husband wants nothing to do with her ex, nor does she want her around the house. Those hazy memories slowly clearing, to reveal faces of Anna, Megan Tom and herself. So what actually happened that night? What happened to Megan? <br><br>            This book with its beautiful descriptions and wonderful character developments is a read you probably shouldn't miss. Narrated from voices of Rachel, Megan and Anna, three wildly contrasting yet emotionally similar people just his different when they are so harmoniously brought together by author Paula Hawkins. MUST READ INDEED !!</p>
