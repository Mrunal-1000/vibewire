        <h1>﻿One of Us Is Lying </h1>
        <p><h2>One Of Us Is Lying - Karen McManus</h2> <br><br>All the crime - thriller lovers  out there, if your recent craving is for a moderately tongue clenching, lip parting and heart warming book to munch on ‘One Of Us Is Lying’ is the book that will satiate you just enough.<br><br>Life as it is, is cruel enough and a shade of that cruelty has been elegantly winded into a beautiful plot by author Karen through the lives of five high school students who are in that wobbly, indecisive explorative youth phase. Making decisions is a hard thing in that phase and making them right is an even bigger ordeal. And exactly that is the focus of this thriller. <br><br> It was probably an ordinary morning for Brownyn, Addy, Cooper and Nate at Bayview high, a prestigious school in their neighbourhood. Each had a seperate thing going on in their life. Brownyn was the class geek, brightest in the class and probably on the way to earning a full scholarship course in Yale University. Meanwhile, Addy, the school princess, literally the homecoming princess, just not the Queen of junior prom, is in a relationship with the homecoming prince, just not the King of junior prom. Match made in heaven you suppose, I definitely did. Cooper could be described as a model American: Tall, blonde hair, sculpted face, shredded body and of course a history of swooning woman at his sight. He was a pitcher in baseball, one trying to make it big at national levels and scouted by a lot of coaches. Nate had a world of his own, dealt drugs to make an earning because no one could do it for him, the earning I mean, father was a hopeless drunkard and mother was a drug addict herself with mental issues. Life was hard but he had a way of  barely skimming through it. They all  had a seemingly normal life, all until that one day which changed it all. Those four got detention with another boy. Simon, his name was. He ran a gossip app that revealed things about his classmates  that were better off a secret. Naturally, he became the most hated person in the class. Few minutes into detention, when the teacher is out of the room, Simon grabs a glass of water to drink, talks to the four getting either awkward or no answers. Suddenly he starts choking! The four of them try their best to help but he ends up dying on the way to hospital. Initially thought an accident, with police investigation turns murder!<br><br> If the questions in your head are “what!?  how!? Or just huh!?”  Grab yourselves a hot drink and settle with the book in a quiet corner as it unravels quite shockingly how the seemingly normal lives of those four had quirks of their own as the police attempt to investigate the mysterious death of Simon. Narrated in four different voices of Brownyn, Addy, Cooper and Nate puts the same plot in four different perspectives at the same time unravelling each one's personal life teasingly enough to keep you engaged all the while. Interesting book indeed, which you must definitely give a read.<br><br>P.S : The plot twist is not what you imagine *wink* . ENJOY READING!</p>
