    "content": "\r<br><br>\r<br><br>I never really knew there was a person called Mr Srikanth Bolla until I saw this movie and I feel you guys who are reading this to be in a similar situation. Not only was this movie entertaining, it was inspirational - something many of the movies that release these days never try to do - inspiring us to live better lives as a living persona in this really dramatic movie life makes us act in!\r<br><br>This biographical movie in HINDI seems to have captured the real essence to what determination, courage and tinge of support could do to anyone trying to accomplish something “hatke” (unique) from the normal ways a life can proceed. Directed by Tushar Hiranandani and Srikanth Bolla was acted by Rajkumar Rao. Other actors that gave the lead actor more life include Jyothika, Alaya F and Sharad Kelkar. \r<br><br>Just take some time and imagine how your life would be if you were born without sight ? Could you have done half the things you have been able to do till now, or any of them actually? Those memories you made that bring a smile to your face or gross you out when you recall them, those people you met and warmed up to, those places you visited and wished to spend the rest of your life in : all that would have just been an arm reach away if it wasn’t covered by that dark veil that seemed to hover in front of your eyes rendering you, almost teasingly, the beauty that  life fills you with if it was perceived with your eyes! So shocking right! Being blind almost reduces the functionality of a person so much. Well, that’s what I think but it was definitely not something that Mr Srikanth thought. He was robbed of this precious gift since his birth but that never did stop him. He was bullied but that made him bolder. He CHOSE to fight his situation than to run away from them and his excuse was simple “How can I run? I am blind, all I can do is fight!” and fight he did. Won many of them too. He lived a life, and continues to do so ( Yes, he is still alive) not giving any hints that he has the inability to see. He studied hard, faced difficulties, fought them - won them, proceeded to study more, got called in by MIT, found love, played cricket, founded the BOLLANT company that is still growing and is its CEO, his business campaign capable of competing with the big sharks in the business industry.\r<br><br>And his life has been so beautifully put together in this movie, it would leave you teary and inspired for sure. He even made it to FORBES magazine under the title ‘30 under 30’. He is an interesting man with more interesting goals in life and beliefs that we all could try to adopt. This movie is not only inspirational but also educational - teaching us that people differently abled just don't need your sympathy or things you do out of that feeling of being sorry for them, Srikanth tells that sometimes all they need is people’s support and a little of their faith in them to do things what they can do without any doubt or discrimination.\r<br><br>It was a great watching experience, and gave a wholesome feel. IMDB rated it a 7.8/10 and rotten tomatoes gave it 4 stars but I believe it deserves everything and more! Great way to spend a few hours on a rough day that makes you feel drained and worthless and looking for some much needed motivation !",

    "title": "Rediscovering TV Gold: The Surprising Revival of Suits",
    "image": "/blogs/entertainment/1721021599638.png",
    "content": "In a surprising turn of events, one of the most-watched shows of 2023 is a series that originally aired over a decade ago. The legal drama Suits first hit the small screen in 2011, during the final wave of USA Network's optimistic \"blue sky\" era of dramas, which included popular titles like Burn Notice, Royal Pains, and Psych. Despite concluding its nine-season run in 2019 with over 130 episodes, Suits has found new life and unprecedented popularity through Netflix, smashing streaming records and captivating a whole new audience with its story of a faux lawyer, his unexpected best friend, and the high-powered law firm that becomes his family.<br><br><h2>The Allure of Suits</h2><br><br>Though Suits is often remembered for featuring Meghan Markle before her royal transformation into the Duchess of Sussex, the heart of the series lies in its compelling characters and dynamic storytelling. The show follows Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), a brilliant college dropout with a photographic memory, who fakes his way into a job at the prestigious law firm Pearson Hardman. Paired with the sharp and charismatic attorney Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht), the duo uses every trick in the book to win cases, from impassioned closing arguments to clever legal loopholes, all while concealing Mike’s secret from the rest of the firm.<br><br><h2>Unforgettable Dynamics and Dialogue</h2><br><br>The chemistry between Macht and Adams is palpable from their first scene together, and the snappy, witty dialogue makes even the driest legal proceedings entertaining. The show’s supporting cast, including the poised senior partner Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres), the dedicated paralegal Rachel Zane (Meghan Markle), and the formidable Donna Paulsen (Sarah Rafferty), who shares a complicated flirtation with Harvey, adds depth and intrigue. However, it is Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) who stands out as the series’ most fascinating and complex character.<br><br><h2>Louis Litt: From Antagonist to Hero</h2><br><br>Initially portrayed as an antagonist to Harvey and Mike, Louis Litt’s character evolves dramatically over the course of the series. When viewers first meet Louis, he is a junior partner at Pearson Hardman, harboring jealousy towards Harvey for being promoted above him. Louis is insecure, paranoid, and often rude, particularly regarding Mike’s entry into the firm. Despite these flaws, a deeper, more compassionate side of Louis emerges, making his character arc one of the most rewarding in the series.<br><br><h2>The Quirky Underdog</h2><br><br>Louis often appears as a bit of an oddball, especially when contrasted with the more traditionally heroic Harvey and Mike. His deep insecurities and desire for acceptance lead him to behave like a try-hard and, at times, a sycophant. Louis is not above using blackmail or emotional manipulation to achieve his goals, actions driven by a fear of inadequacy. However, Suits does not shy away from exploring the anxiety that fuels many of Louis’s decisions, allowing viewers to empathize with his vulnerabilities.<br><br><h2>The Hardest Worker in the Room</h2><br><br>Despite his eccentricities, Louis is the firm’s hardest worker, often exceeding even Harvey’s billable hours. His dedication to the law and his genuine love for the legal profession contrast sharply with the cutthroat nature of the firm. Louis’s passion for his work, combined with his offbeat hobbies like \"mudding\" and his love for cats, make him a uniquely endearing character. He also delivers some of the show’s most memorable lines, adding humor and humanity to the legal battles.<br><br><h2>Loyalty and Sentimentality</h2><br><br>Louis’s loyalty and sentimentality are key aspects of his character. He deeply craves belonging and validation, traits that Rick Hoffman masterfully portrays with a blend of quirky mannerisms and heartfelt sincerity. His desire to be part of the team is poignantly illustrated in moments like when he bakes a cake for Mike, welcoming him to \"Team Litt.\" These gestures reveal Louis’s longing for genuine connections and friendship.<br><br><h2>Passion and Complexity</h2><br><br>What sets Louis apart is his intense passion. While he is not always likable, his motivations are clear and relatable. He cares deeply about everything, from his cats to the interns at the firm, and he fights fiercely for what he believes in. This passion sometimes leads him to make impulsive decisions, resulting in professional and personal turmoil. Yet, his heart is usually in the right place, and he is often his own harshest critic.<br><br><h2>Louis’s Transformation</h2><br><br>Louis’s journey from a flawed, insecure individual to a confident leader is a testament to his character’s depth. His growth is driven by his determination to overcome his worst instincts and become a better person. By the series' end, Louis has earned his place as a named partner, found love, and embraced fatherhood. His story is one of struggle, redemption, and personal triumph, making his character arc the most fulfilling in the series.<br><br><h2>Conclusion: The Littastic Legacy</h2><br><br>Louis Litt’s evolution from a petty, insecure junior partner to a respected leader and friend is a highlight of Suits. His character embodies the show's themes of personal growth, loyalty, and the pursuit of justice. As viewers rediscover Suits on Netflix, Louis Litt stands out as a character who, despite his flaws, captures the essence of what makes the series enduringly popular. His story is a reminder that true strength lies in embracing one’s vulnerabilities and striving for self-improvement, a journey that is undeniably, and wonderfully, Littastic.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>",

    "content": "<h2>One Of Us Is Lying - Karen McManus</h2> \r<br><br>All the crime - thriller lovers  out there, if your recent craving is for a moderately tongue clenching, lip parting and heart warming book to munch on ‘One Of Us Is Lying’ is the book that will satiate you just enough.\r<br><br>Life as it is, is cruel enough and a shade of that cruelty has been elegantly winded into a beautiful plot by author Karen through the lives of five high school students who are in that wobbly, indecisive explorative youth phase. Making decisions is a hard thing in that phase and making them right is an even bigger ordeal. And exactly that is the focus of this thriller. \r<br><br> It was probably an ordinary morning for Brownyn, Addy, Cooper and Nate at Bayview high, a prestigious school in their neighbourhood. Each had a seperate thing going on in their life. Brownyn was the class geek, brightest in the class and probably on the way to earning a full scholarship course in Yale University. Meanwhile, Addy, the school princess, literally the homecoming princess, just not the Queen of junior prom, is in a relationship with the homecoming prince, just not the King of junior prom. Match made in heaven you suppose, I definitely did. Cooper could be described as a model American: Tall, blonde hair, sculpted face, shredded body and of course a history of swooning woman at his sight. He was a pitcher in baseball, one trying to make it big at national levels and scouted by a lot of coaches. Nate had a world of his own, dealt drugs to make an earning because no one could do it for him, the earning I mean, father was a hopeless drunkard and mother was a drug addict herself with mental issues. Life was hard but he had a way of  barely skimming through it. They all  had a seemingly normal life, all until that one day which changed it all. Those four got detention with another boy. Simon, his name was. He ran a gossip app that revealed things about his classmates  that were better off a secret. Naturally, he became the most hated person in the class. Few minutes into detention, when the teacher is out of the room, Simon grabs a glass of water to drink, talks to the four getting either awkward or no answers. Suddenly he starts choking! The four of them try their best to help but he ends up dying on the way to hospital. Initially thought an accident, with police investigation turns murder!\r<br><br> If the questions in your head are “what!?  how!? Or just huh!?”  Grab yourselves a hot drink and settle with the book in a quiet corner as it unravels quite shockingly how the seemingly normal lives of those four had quirks of their own as the police attempt to investigate the mysterious death of Simon. Narrated in four different voices of Brownyn, Addy, Cooper and Nate puts the same plot in four different perspectives at the same time unravelling each one's personal life teasingly enough to keep you engaged all the while. Interesting book indeed, which you must definitely give a read.\r<br><br>P.S : The plot twist is not what you imagine *wink* . ENJOY READING!",

    "content": "<h2>The Girl On The Train - Paula Hawkins</h2>\r<br><br>            Life, men and women are probably those three things that fuss a lot. Never satisfied, never convinced and never really truthful. Some of that very fuss, that completely unnecessary, untimely and unwanted fuss is the central item around which this nail biting thriller wheels around. \r<br><br>            In this Paula’s first book, set around the London suburbs which couldn't have been more beautifully described than through the eyes of Rachel, a daily train commuter to London. A woman tired with her work, with life and with herself. Her tiredness due to her inability to bear a child. Tom, her husband supported her in all the ways he could but she couldn't come to terms with herself. She was upset, turned to drinking and became its frequent indulger. Each time with a more fierce hangover and a blanker hour of action, where she would do things that she couldn't believe she could do. Tom got tired of this and found another woman, more stable, more loving and younger to be showered with and shower love. Her name was Anna. Rachel's case worsened as she was bought off her own house and shooed away like she was nothing.\r<br><br>            With all this pent up frustration and anger, she put up a staright face and commuted for work by train, which by cruel play of life had to pass behind the backs of a row of houses, one of them being hers  - Anna’s now and her baby. But she was intersted about another house. A house whose occupants were  a beautiful couple so in love that reminded Rachel her old days with Tom. She didn't know them, but her daily travel to and fro just across their house made her feel she was connected to them, she felt obligated to protect that intimacy they shared. She gave them names that she seemed suited for them. Jason and Jess, she decided. But ofcourse in this fussy world, without a little fuss nothing runs, through the same window which showed Jess in her peaceful lovey dovey life, showed her kissing a complete stranger !! She felt sad but anger overtook soon. Why would Jess want to cheat when everything could'nt be more perfect in her life? She wanted to confront her that day. She thought drinking would give her more edge while confronting, but the next day she got up bruises on her arms and legs and with no memory as to what happened that night. Shockingly she realised that the same night was the night that Megan (Jess) went missing !!\r<br><br>         What happened that night? What did her memory betray her off? Was she involved or someone else? Her memory a complete haze unwilling to uncloud. She wanted to help, there was this involuntary need to do so. Guilt maybe? But of what?. She went to Scott (Jason) to tell him about what she knows and each visit clearing a part of the haze but causing problems with Anna and Tom. Anna being overly possessive over her new husband wants nothing to do with her ex, nor does she want her around the house. Those hazy memories slowly clearing, to reveal faces of Anna, Megan Tom and herself. So what actually happened that night? What happened to Megan? \r<br><br>            This book with its beautiful descriptions and wonderful character developments is a read you probably shouldn't miss. Narrated from voices of Rachel, Megan and Anna, three wildly contrasting yet emotionally similar people just his different when they are so harmoniously brought together by author Paula Hawkins. MUST READ INDEED !!",

    "content": "      Had a long week? Want something not too wild nor too sad, just something to lighten the mood with sweet feelings? We have got you covered.\r<br><br>        The Royal Treatment could be just the break you need. A rom-com in virtue with comedy being its major expression in the movie couldn't depict “life is as easy as you make it” more vibrantly. Dealing  with  feelings that people normally do feel and thankfully not having the slightest amount of cringe that is expected with rom-com movies, it was a pleasant watching experience. I would personally give it a 7/10. Rotten tomatoes give it a 5.6/10 but I recommend you figure that on your own.\r<br><br>         Not to spoil much but just to feed your curiosity that hopefully doesn't kill, the story revolves around a hair stylist , named Isabella (played by Laura Marano) Izzy for short who owns a salon in New York with her mother, her Nonna and friends. Budding as she is, her life seems to be the very opposite of her jolly character. Amidst all this worry and chaos, enters the charming prince Thomas (played by Mena Massoud) from Lavonia, who visits America to see to the arrangements made for his marriage with Laura  La Mott, the daughter of the La Motts. All he needed to do was to fix his hair. It's plenty  entertaining to watch the free ,wild  and chaotic life of Izzy meeting the rather dull, monotonic and suffocating life of Thomas colliding in an exciting  manner and the adventure they take on from there on.\r<br><br>        The spirited nature of Izzy is almost contagious and Marano's acting just made it more real. Prince Thomas's life could be relatable to some of us and Mena's acting just conveyed it all. All in all a very rounded movie with themes not just mainly focusing on love but with virtues like sharing and giving respect have also been touched upon.  The right kind of movie to momentarily jolt you from a busy working week for some good found entertainment.",
