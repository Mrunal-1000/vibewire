        <h1>﻿The Royal Treatment </h1>
        <p>      Had a long week? Want something not too wild nor too sad, just something to lighten the mood with sweet feelings? We have got you covered.<br><br>        The Royal Treatment could be just the break you need. A rom-com in virtue with comedy being its major expression in the movie couldn't depict “life is as easy as you make it” more vibrantly. Dealing  with  feelings that people normally do feel and thankfully not having the slightest amount of cringe that is expected with rom-com movies, it was a pleasant watching experience. I would personally give it a 7/10. Rotten tomatoes give it a 5.6/10 but I recommend you figure that on your own.<br><br>         Not to spoil much but just to feed your curiosity that hopefully doesn't kill, the story revolves around a hair stylist , named Isabella (played by Laura Marano) Izzy for short who owns a salon in New York with her mother, her Nonna and friends. Budding as she is, her life seems to be the very opposite of her jolly character. Amidst all this worry and chaos, enters the charming prince Thomas (played by Mena Massoud) from Lavonia, who visits America to see to the arrangements made for his marriage with Laura  La Mott, the daughter of the La Motts. All he needed to do was to fix his hair. It's plenty  entertaining to watch the free ,wild  and chaotic life of Izzy meeting the rather dull, monotonic and suffocating life of Thomas colliding in an exciting  manner and the adventure they take on from there on.<br><br>        The spirited nature of Izzy is almost contagious and Marano's acting just made it more real. Prince Thomas's life could be relatable to some of us and Mena's acting just conveyed it all. All in all a very rounded movie with themes not just mainly focusing on love but with virtues like sharing and giving respect have also been touched upon.  The right kind of movie to momentarily jolt you from a busy working week for some good found entertainment.</p>
